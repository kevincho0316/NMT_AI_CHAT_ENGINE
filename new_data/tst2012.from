The entire ESPNFC television show is essentially a bunch of arrogant Scots who look down on Americans, US Soccer, and MLS, with no hint of irony despite the fact that they're from f*cking Scotland, because that's what the self-loathing Eurodouchebag college kids who started following the Premier League 2-3 years ago (see [demographics of /r/soccer](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/2qpzf4/the_rsoccer_2014300k_subscribers_census_results/cn8ehzw)) expect from soccer pundits. They'd do the exact same to your team if the opportunity arose.

Listen, I am not an NYCFC fan and will not pretend their existence doesn't piss me off because of the Chivas bullshit that foreshadowed this happening, but I do not blame NYCFC fans for it. That said, Third Rail needs to go fucking mental. NYCFC is Garber's baby, and if it fails, it is a direct Garber screw up, and if the Third Rail turns into an issue, the league will take notice. newlinechar  newlinechar You all need to protest, scream, yell, and do everything possible to cause a commotion. Every support group does, but the Third Rail needs to be the leader on this. There is going to be a lockout, and it is going to be ugly, but once it is over, the fans in this league need to send a goddamn message that **this bullshit cannot, will not, and will never be acceptable**. newlinechar  newlinechar This needs to be Garber's Watergate, Lewinsky, and Teapot Dome all in one. He needs to be gone. He is hurting the league, and we need to send the message to our owners that Garber cannot continue as commissioner.  This needs to be a coordinated effort, and I believe the Third Rail needs to be the leader of it.

Nope. Hi.
&gt;But, looking past the naming convention, we already have the bulldog repeater and the name bulldog doesn't represent a long range fighter very well, which is the primary attribute of the deep space fighter. newlinechar  newlinechar So, in other words, ignoring your primary argument, which you have been continuing to argue in this thread despite the lack of evidence supporting it (IMO). newlinechar  newlinechar Whether or not the name fits the purpose is a matter of opinion. I can't fault you your opinion, and I see where you're coming from, but IMO an equally primary attribute of the Bulldog according to its description is its stoutness and durability, which the name reflects quite well. newlinechar  newlinechar There already being a weapon named the Bulldog is a legitimate point, which makes me wonder why it's not much more than an afterthought in the OP. That said, it's not as if it's not something that happens in real life (for example: [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Bulldog), [2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_Arms_Bulldog)). newlinechar  newlinechar IDK, overall I like the name. I see valid reasons to change it and equally valid reasons to keep it, I wouldn't be opposed to either outcome. CIG will do what they think is best and I'll be happy with it.

Sure, you can. But they generally go a lot better if you're partaking as well. It probably doesn't make sense from a pure cash outflow analysis now, but for me it goes into greater relationship building that ends up directly affecting my salary. There's something to be said for the social effect alcohol has on building relationships. I have to deal with my boss in a very professional manner 95% of the time I'm around him, but he's good about cutting back and building our relationship personally when he takes us out to bars. This ends up affecting how we interact when we're back at the office. If he generally likes me as a person outside of work, it makes dealing with the things that come up inside work a lot easier, and usually translates into him being more willing to invest time into teaching me which helps me perform better and meet his expectations more easily. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, for client expenses it's always covered. At training events with my peers it's more hit or miss. At this stage in my career, it's an expense I don't mind having. As I get into my 30s this will definitely shift, but I have a ton more people to meet/work with. Free booze is the modern day mana from above. I won't argue with that!

Not going to know you are a girl if you don't bring attention to it. If a group of friends knew you were a man before becoming a women then it's different but if you find new people they won't know. Either way you shouldn't give a shit about others caring if you are male or female

Most Northerners don't. I have a friend from New York. He invited some of his friends down to visit. We decided to take them to Deep Ellum in Dallas. We got in the car, headed out. After about twenty minutes one asks from the back seat, 'what state are we in now?' 'Texas man, in about another ten minutes we will cross the county line.' 'Wow, how long would it take us to get out of Texas?' He asks. 'In this direction, about three or four hours. Depending on traffic.'

Absolutely. I'm bummed because, otherwise, I thought she was wonderful. I'd never met anyone quite like her and was hoping we would at very least be friends. I felt there was definitely a romantic spark between us--but I couldn't get past the nagging part of me that suggested the old axiom 'if she wanted to spend time with you, she would make time for you.' I guess I kind of always knew this might happen, but I'm upset at her choice of method. To maintain contact for 4 months and then just vanish one day without warning is pretty lame.

I'll start us off I suppose, a fairly long time ago me and my boyfriend went to a swinger party where I had met a really nice girl. I've never really been into girl on girl sex, I find penis-less sex less than appealing, though I've only ever tried it myself once. Skip forward to when me and this girl, who I shall call 'Megan' in bed, I'd taken off her pants, and after rubbing the middle of her panties, found a rather peculiar shape from the inside. After pulling them down, *PLOP!* out came a penis. newlinechar  newlinechar I freaked out and ran to my boyfriend (Who was waiting in the living room), as if it was some kind of roach as I was a helpless school girl. A minute later or so Megan came out crying, deeply hurt by how I reacted.

No doubt you're still better. Levy stands out an obviously better LB than anyone on the Bears today, even if you still count Briggs. But the Bears DL I think is comparable to the Lions without Suh.

Its pretty often.  I mean there has been at least one batman related comic about Gotham's mystical side in print since early 2000s (Batman: Dark Knight, Batman Eternal, etc.).

Right, the same way you would when you play it normally on your PS4.
I just can't wrap my head around that happening though. In the comics, Daisy, Black Widow and Fury are the only agents with level 10 clearance, or something to that affect. Daisy is *fiercely* loyal to Shield, so we know she would never betray the good guys, and that's all good and great! I have a feeling on the other hand, this subreddit is trying to hard to introduce Ward as the epitome of evil in the show. And for Ward to be so blinded by an obsession that he thinks is true love could make him the true threat of a season or two is too easy for the writers, not to mention in my mind, is somewhat unrealistic. If Wards thinks his true feelings of love for Skye are real, then all those moments where we see him improve when Skye is around and redeem himself do not point in the direction of someone descending into a fit of madness and the desire to murder. It makes Wards character childish, and I don't believe that's what Ward really is. Personally, I think that now that Skye has shot Ward, and proven that his endeavours to win back Skye are fruitless, he will simply leave from her life in silence. Over the rest of the season, with Agent 33 by his side, I think he will be realistic with himself and try to rid her from his mind as best he can, though that's not to say I think we will succeed. I believe he will always have feelings for skye, but he will just be able to control and understand them better. newlinechar  newlinechar TL;DR Ward won't be a 'Super Villain', he will finally try to give Skye some distance and God knows where that will take him

&gt; No, she looked gross at 200lbs, saying she did is an insult to her hard work and dedication. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, only if you assume that the only reason to lose weight is to please other people with the way you look...
When I doubleclick thurst left and thurst right a panel called assignment panel opens up and I followed your method but it doesnt work.... Sorry if I am missing something here.

&gt; If I wanted a wildcat varmint upper, it'd be 223AI newlinechar  newlinechar I'd though about an improved 223, and it definitely struck my fancy. newlinechar  newlinechar I also looked into the 20 practical.  But my biggest draw to the 20 tactical is that there is that there seems to be no fire-forming required.  Just size and go. 
Ok, thats too bad its kinda worthless for me at this point. Could you explain what I should do with bronze/silver/gold badges? Do you think badges are the best way to get good players, or no? Thanks btw, ive been kinda lost on badges and things.
...I have no idea what that means.
Such a limited selection on some of them. 
Doing ok. Sorta out tonight but there is a tv here. So I'm glued in front of it. At least until dinner time. 
shower or B'elanna?
This all depends. Normally when the accessories are opened the boxes arent ripped apart and can be sold again as new but with a discount. Considering you tore the box up it will be up to the managers discretion as to how they would proceed with the return. Chances are you'll more than likely just be given a new one or store credit. 
Ive been eyeballing this on ebay for a month now, tell me about the fake please.
We could hook up and touch winkies!
Give it another week at least that's normal for late flower, maybe yellowing a little early but it should be okay
It's just really difficult/expensive to pull off with only 4 DIMM slots. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Hmmm you sure about 64 on *most*? The 4770K only supports up to 32GB. Looks like only the i7x's support 64GB.
Wow is that true? When I mount my bike, I have to stand on the left footpeg to hoist my leg over since my bike is a little tall for me... Is it really that bad to put all that weight on the kickstand?..
So, never live in Gotham unless you are a ghostbuster.

I'm guessing he changed what he said?  Because what he has now doesn't seem to be too bad.

What am I missing here?
&gt; It's still hard, you know? Like, even for men who are trying newlinechar  newlinechar It absolutely is. But the charity and love you show by continuing in the effort does you great credit and will earn you many blessings. 
Can you clarify what you mean? Are you referring to acceleration due to the gravitational force?

Hi. Want to mope around and watch depressing movies on Lifetime together? I have blankets.
The Brakk can be earned by running Invasions for the Corpus. You'll be Marked by the Grineer and hunted down by their assassin unit, the Grustrag Three. The G3 drop Brakk components and BPs, along with rare mods (Multishots, Natural Talent).

Not actually near the city centre. Singapore being an island city-state, Changi is as far as you can get if you head east. However the areas around it has significantly built-up, so it's surrounded by airport buildings. newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry, I hope I don't appear as a smartarse. I was born there.
Me too. My little sister could kick Tim's ass. 
I noticed that, too. They'refore I gave you an upvote. Their are many people who still don't know that the difference. There grammar skills might need some revitalization. I guess their just not as smart as you and me.
fluke or bust baby! unfortunately someone stole that one from my bag and I had to cough up 150 bucks to replace it. 
But then all the car numbers would have to be in metric!

Yeah, the thing to realize with the right is that they've realized the best way to mute certain weaknesses is to rage about that weakness being present in their opponent. Liberals are big govt spenders!!!!

I was under the impression that you couldn't do custom flair on this sub.
That makes sense. At the same time, if you're already doing all the work of online advertising, deviantart, facebook etc, wouldn't it be a bonus for people to be able to come in and look at your artwork? There are plenty of home businesses that do well while having a home location (I'm thinking cleaning or metalwork or mechanics etc). I don't see it so much as an end-all be-all without any sort of advertising. I just wonder why it wouldn't be an added bonus on top of selling your work online if you're not able to get into galleries/uninterested in selling in galleries. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I forgot to add to your point on cheap shared space. I'm pretty far from the city. I'm in a very well populated area but around 2 or 3 hours from the city. I don't have a dime to spend on a rented space, but setting up the garage is a possibility as I wouldn't have to pay anything extra. I think I'm more wondering if there's anything legally I would have to do, or if I could just set it up and put signs out front. At least some sort of business licence I would imagine?
Because you'll feel like absolute crap if you do. 
9 1 1? Yes, I believe I am about to be oppressed by some people on the internet! What proof do I have? Well, there are a few screenshots from omegle posted by anonymous people having a conversation with other anonymous people.
There are more than just the 3 I cited.  Many more. They all agree that the gas chambers were real. The best you can do is to criticize Dario Gabbai's memory of the color of the bodies (never mind that a thousand people trying to climb over each other likely end up pretty black and blue).  newlinechar  newlinechar The sonderkommando survivors recollections match the Auschwitz  Protocols, which match the statements at Nuremberg. Subsequent guards from Auschwitz have voluntarily come forward decades later because people denying the reality of the gas chambers disgusted them. 
You can't have a girlfriend if she doesn't exist. This joke is really logically and physically impossible, and makes no sense.
You could report it to the admins. What those accounts are doing is shadowbannable.
