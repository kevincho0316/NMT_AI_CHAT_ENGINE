Sure, but people aren't upset that he's given a new account and a reason for the previous accounts being odd... people are upset that the new account doesn't explain why he made himself MORE involved in the previous accounts. newlinechar EDIT: To be clearer, his stated reasons for the earlier stories being false may make sense but why did he OVERSTATE his involvement if the truth is as he explained in the new interview? That makes no sense to me... unless he was helping the police bulk up their case against Adnan... which is, in and of itself, problematic.

Dave Reisner initially packages systemd for archlinux and back in the early days it was a lot of work to run. You had to write all your own units, etc. I remember the first time I tried to switch to systemd and after that whole ordeal my system wouldn't shutdown correctly... it was in the background for archlinux for a while. newlinechar  newlinechar What happened was two-fold: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. rc.conf was showing cracks. It used to configure everything but slowly things started leaving it. Stuff like `/etc/modprobe.d` or `/etc/module-load.d` landed which provided a better interface than the rc.conf file. Networking started getting too complicated to stick entirely in rc.conf so netcfg was made. But netcfg then ment code duplication with rc.conf. Backgrounding processes in rc.conf was a hack at best, etc, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. The developers, one by one, started going out of their way to use systemd over initscripts. The systemd switchover came when they realized they had no one testing the initscripts anymore. And no-one competent steped up. newlinechar  newlinechar Archlinux, for better or worse, revolves around the whims of the dev team. It is their baby and they make it suit themselves. With the mindshare shifted to systemd, it only made sense to transistion to it for ease of maintinance.

It's a nice knife. Funny someone would make such a decent fake when they could clearly make an original design with similar quality. The only thing really wrong with it is the pivot needs to be loktited, otherwise it gets really loose rather quickly. Once it's good and tight thought, it flips like a dream. I've owned a good number of flippers and this guy is up with the best of them. The anodizing looks great. clip is a decent balance between easy in/out without chewing up your pants. The blade centering on this one is immaculate. It feels good in my medium glove sized hands, nice and cozy, it'd be pretty hard for it to slip out of my hand. The end of the framelock where it meets the bottom of the blade has a steel bit screwed into place to prevent issues with the titanium. Besides the issue with the pivot, there's really no jimping anywhere except for the backspace, which is okay, this isn't really a tactical knife, but if jimping is your thing, there's not much to be had. I can't vouch for edge retention yet, as I've only ravaged some cardboard and paper, but so far it's held up just fine. Otherwise, this is something similar in fit and finish to a Benchmade from what I can tell. 
I don't want anything serious though. As long as you promise 0 emotional attachment.

I only feel modest in clothing that makes me look like a little girl.
